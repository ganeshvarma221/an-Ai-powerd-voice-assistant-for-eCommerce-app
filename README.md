# an Ai powerd voice assistant for eCommerce app

Voice-assisted commerce is a form of conversational commerce, in which a user interacts with a business through voice recognition technology. Unlike the traditional eCommerce, where a user either just types in a search query or selects by pointing and clicking, voice-assisted commerce works on the voice command of a user. Popular examples are Amazon Echo, Siri, Cortana, and Google Home.
